# hello-world

This is a test of the emergency re-learning system.  This is only a test.  If this had been an actual emergency requiring me to learn something I would not have taken time to record this full message.

I now return you to your regularly scheduled life which, hopefully, is more interesting than reading a stupid readme file.
